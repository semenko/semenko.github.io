I'm an Assistant Professor at the Medical College of Wisconsin ([MCW](https://www.mcw.edu/)) and founding member of MCW's new [Data Science Institute](https://www.mcw.edu/departments/data-science-institute). As a physician-scientist, I study liquid biopsies (including cell-free DNA) and their applications as biomarkers in a range of rare and understudied diseases (including sepsis). I am also an attending physician (seeing both inpatients and outpatients) and I have a passion for information security as it applies to healthcare and medical devices.

Previously, I was a research-track instructor and attending physician at Washington University, within the Division of Oncology, and member of the Siteman Cancer Center. I completed my postdoctoral studies with [Dr. Aadel Chaudhuri](https://chaudhurilab.wustl.edu/) and my fellowship in [Endocrinology, Metabolism, and Lipid Research](https://endocrinology.wustl.edu/) at WashU, through the Physician Scientist Training Program. Prior to fellowship, I was an Internal Medicine resident at the [Brigham and Women's Hospital](https://www.brighamandwomens.org/) in Boston. I did my MD/PhD at WashU (as part of the NIH Medical Scientist Training Program), where I was advised by [Dr. Jeff I. Gordon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_I._Gordon) and funded by the [NHGRI](https://www.genome.gov/). My [PhD thesis](https://doi.org/10.7936/K77M06C1) in genetics explored the impact of the gut microbiota on host epigenetic signaling, as assayed by ATAC-seq.

I graduated from MIT with degrees in Course 6 (Computer Science) and Course 7 (Biology), and briefly spent time at Google working on a framework to manage extremely large scientific datasets. At MIT, I also served as Editor in Chief of the student newspaper [The Tech](https://thetech.com/).

In information security, I'm currently developing a public ranking system for the security of healthcare systems (similar to the US News rankings), and previously wrote much of the modern Chrome version of the EFF's [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) extension.

If you're bored, you can follow my [main-belt asteroid](https://minorplanetcenter.net/db_search/show_object?object_id=18015) — which looks like it's having a great time just a bit past Mars — or check the status of [this legislation](http://www.senate.mo.gov/17info/BTS_Web/Bill.aspx?SessionType=R&BillID=57095289) I helped draft that would require healthcare workers to receive yearly influenza vaccinations (long before the pandemic made that cool).
